# _Band_Venue_Tracker_

##### _{Allows users to keep track of bands and venues they may played}, {9/2/2015}_

#### By _**{Chris Underwood}**_

## Description

_{This application allows bands and venues to be tracked together or independently. Each can be added individually and then connected. Items that have been connected can be edited and deleted. Individual items can be viewed with their current relationships to each other. Bands and Venues saved with a starting capital letter. Blank names are not accepted for Bands or Venues}_

## Setup

Download the code, bundle install the Gemfile, migrate the databases, start up Sinatra and you should be good to go.

If you find anything else that I missed, please let me know.


## Technologies Used

Ruby, Active Record, Postgres (although this should be platform agnostic), many-to-many relationships, all 4 CRUD methods, validations, callbacks, and Sinatra. RSpec and Pry for testing and bug-fixing
